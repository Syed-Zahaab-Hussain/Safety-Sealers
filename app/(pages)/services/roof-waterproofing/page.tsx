        <p>We have bccn using: Roofing Felts in the following categories:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-8">
          <li>Fiber based to BS747:1968,1970 and 1977 and ASTM</li>
          <li>Fabric based (cotton fabric)based to ASTM D-173:79</li>
          <li>Jute based to BS6398:1983 and ASTM</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          These all are bases and although sandwitched in proper grades of
          bitumen are liable to deterioration Polyester fleece, which is
          inorganic and thus inert and rot proof is now available in Pakistan
          and we started manufacturing Polyester based Bitumen Felt conforming
          to BS747 Amendment 1986 type 5U. These felts are more durable and long
          lasting and are now the mainstay of our root and subgrade
          waterproofing work as per our specification no SS2D and SS-7.
        </p>

        <p>
          Polyester Felt to BS747:1986 type 5U with Aluminum foil laminated on
          one side of the Felt in our spec SS-7 provides and additional
          protection coupled with reflective insulation property, a vital
          requirement in summer conditions of Pakistan
        </p>
        <p>
          There arc other permutations available In effective usc of
          waterproofing materials suiting various budgets and we advise about
          them from iob to iob.

          Bitumen plays an Important role In effective waterproofing and the
          selection of a proper grade is vital. Leaflet on Oxybit Bitumen is
          enclosed. , addition of Rubberized bitumen- which is ultraviolet rays
          resistant and has better flow, is an addition to our product range.
