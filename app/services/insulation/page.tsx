          Insulation ot root' besides providing relief from cold and heat
          reduces the energy bills and its initial cost is justified in the end.
        </p>

        <p>Various types of insulating materials are available, namely:</p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-8">
          <li>Foam concrete screed</li>
          <li>Foamed gypsum screed</li>
          <li>Polyurethane spray</li>
          <li>Polyurethane spray</li>
          <li>Newly developed Jumbolon N Board</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          While specifying or using Insulation materials it must be remembered
          that "WEI INSUALATION IS NO INSUALATION" and utmost care has to be
          taken to keep these materials dry. Foam concrete and gypsum absorb
          water and their continued immersion in water or their exposion to rain
          turn them into deterioting sponge with no insulation value. They must
          be covered with a minimum of 1/2 thick 1:4 cement sand screed and then
          properly waterproofed to keep their insulation value in tact.
          Similarly all the insulation boards available in Pakistan absorbs a
          certain percentage of moisture or water and their insulation value ( k
          factor ) is adversely affected.
        </p>

        <p>
          polystyrene or other insulation boards must not be directly covered
          with sand cement or concrete screeds as the ssater from these
          coverings sits permanently in their pores and they lose their
          insulation value making the expense going to waste. In such cases
          covering or s.wapping in heavy gauge polythene is recommended.
        </p>
        <p>
          Closed cell polystyrene board such as Roof Mate by ICI does not absorb
          moisture and is best suited for insulation of buildings but it is not
          made in Pakistan and its high cost coupled vvith the volumatic high
          fright are the factors to consider.
        </p>

        <p>
          High density 32 Kg/m3 expanded polystyrene boards are now available in
          Pakistan and when wrapped in polythene sheets (minimum weighing 80
          Sqft per KG) counteract the water absorption factor and in 50.mm thick
          these boards provide 1.5 u value for the composite roof, considered
          adequate by international standards.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our technical services Department works out the thickness of the
          insulating materials for given value of the insulation required or
          specified.
